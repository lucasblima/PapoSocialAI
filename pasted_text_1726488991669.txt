### **2. Explanation of Key Folders and Files**

#### **Agents Folder (agents/)**
This folder holds the Python scripts for each CrewAI agent that you will use for the content creation and management processes. Each agent will have its own configuration in the `agents.yaml` file, and their behavior will be described in their respective Python scripts.

- `strategic_planner.py`: This script will contain the logic for the **Strategic Planner** agent, who defines the overall content strategy.
- `research_analyst.py`: This script will manage the **Research Analyst** agent, who handles data collection and trend analysis.
- `content_architect.py`: This script defines the **Content Architect** agent, who is responsible for article creation.
- `content_curator.py`: This script will manage the **Content Curator** agent, ensuring that the content is always up to date and relevant.

#### **Tasks Folder (tasks/)**
Each task that an agent can execute is defined here. This includes tasks like content strategy creation, trend research, article writing, and curation.

- `create_content_strategy.py`: Defines the steps and logic for the **Strategic Planner** to create a comprehensive content strategy.
- `research_trends.py`: Contains the steps for the **Research Analyst** to identify emerging trends and analyze audience preferences.
- `content_creation.py`: Handles the actual writing of content, including article structure and engagement techniques.
- `content_curation.py`: Contains the logic for ensuring that content remains fresh and relevant through continuous updates.

#### **Tools Folder (tools/)**
The tools that each agent requires are stored here. These may include data analysis tools, SEO tools, content monitoring tools, etc. Each tool will interact with the agents based on the tasks they need to accomplish.

- `data_analysis_tool.py`: A tool for analyzing data trends.
- `trend_forecasting_tool.py`: Forecasts upcoming trends based on current data.
- `research_tools.py`: Used by the **Research Analyst** for gathering and analyzing research.
- `seo_tool.py`: Helps the **Content Architect** optimize articles for search engines.
- `interactive_content_creation_tool.py`: A tool for generating interactive content.
- `continuous_monitoring_tool.py`: Monitors real-time trends and content relevance.

#### **Config Folder (config/)**
This is the core configuration folder, where YAML files define agents, tasks, and processes.

- `agents.yaml`: Defines the roles, goals, tools, and execution modes for each agent (Strategic Planner, Research Analyst, Content Architect, and Content Curator).
- `tasks.yaml`: Lists all the tasks that each agent can execute, along with the expected outputs.
- `process.yaml`: Configures whether the tasks are executed in a sequential or hierarchical process, and sets memory and caching options.

#### **Logs Folder (logs/)**
All logs related to task execution and agent performance will be stored here, allowing you to track the system's performance.

- `execution_logs.txt`: A log of all tasks that agents have executed, including timestamps and status (success, error, etc.).
- `feedback_logs.txt`: A log of the feedback provided to agents and the corresponding changes made.

#### **Memory Folder (memory/)**
This folder stores the long-term memory of the system, allowing agents to retain context from past tasks. A database file (e.g., SQLite) will be used to store this information.

- `memory_storage.db`: A database file where long-term memory data is stored.

#### **Cache Folder (cache/)**
Cached data will be stored here for faster retrieval of repeated requests or previously generated content.

- `cache_storage.db`: A cache database that temporarily stores results of tasks and data retrievals for better performance.

#### **Monitoring Folder (monitoring/)**
This folder contains the files required to set up a monitoring interface for real-time visualization of the agents' progress, task statuses, and performance metrics.

- `dashboard.py`: Displays a live dashboard showing the status of all agents and tasks.
- `status.py`: Provides a detailed status report on the ongoing and completed tasks.
- `reports.py`: Generates reports on agent performance, task outcomes, and overall system productivity.

#### **Main Files**

- `main.py`: This is the main entry point to run the program. It initializes the agents, tasks, and processes, and starts the content creation and management system.
- `crew.py`: This file will configure the **CrewAI** settings, including the agents, tasks, memory, caching, and process flow (sequential/hierarchical). This file will be key in managing the entire CrewAI setup.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all the dependencies required for the project (CrewAI, LangChain, OpenAI, etc.).
- `README.md`: Describes how to use the system, including setup instructions, how to run tasks, and how to monitor agent progress.
